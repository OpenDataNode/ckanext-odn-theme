" <p>ODN is publication platform for open data supporting whole process of"

" <p>Organizations, companies or even individuals wishing to publish Open "
"Data from existing information systems usually face a lot of troubles "
"stemming from where the data currently is:</p> <ul> <li> Data is usually "
"in internal systems, isolated from the Internet, from the general public,"
" isolated even from the rest of the organization itself and its staff. "
"</li> <li> Data is maintained in complex, heterogeneous environments, "
"using wide variety of formats and employing a lot of different "
"technologies to access it and process it. </li> </ul> <p>This sometimes "
"forces those wishing to publish Open Data either to abandon such plans or"
" to make some compromises, such as publishing only manually, forgetting "
"or not being able to produce timely updates, needed clean-up, etc.</p> "
"<p>In order to publish Open Data from such systems properly, i.e. using "
"Open formats, in machine readable form and in timely manner, <strong>Open"
" Data Node does following:</strong></p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>it extracts "
"(harvests) data from internal systems</strong> using any available "
"interface and method to do that safely, effectively, with low costs,</p> "
"</li> <li> <p><strong>it processes that data</strong>, performing format "
"conversions, cleansing, anonymization, enrichment, linking, etc. (and as "
"part of that also compiling some metadata about that data)</p> </li> <li>"
" <p><strong>it stores the results</strong> (data and metadata too), "
"serving effectively as cache, protecting internal systems from "
"overloading in case of high demand for data from users,</p> </li> <li> "
"<p><strong>it makes the results available to the general public and "
"businesses</strong> supporting both common users (with usual office tools"
" on PCs or other devices) and application developers (equipped with "
"powerful software development tools and above average hardware), "
"implementing also automated and efficient distribution of updated data "
"increments and dataset replication (including metadata),</p> </li> <li> "
"<p><strong>it allows all this to be automated, easy to use and easy to "
"maintain.</strong></p> </li> </ol> <p>In other words and shortened: "
"<strong>Open Data Node helps publishers</strong> of Open Data with the "
"complexity of source data and <strong>continuously delivers easy to use "
"and high quality Open Data to the users</strong>.</p> <h2>And, what it "
"is?</h2> <p>To some degree, <strong>ODN already is</strong>. Its main "
"component was released recently <a "
"href=\"http://www.comsode.eu/index.php/2014/04/unifiedviews-an-etl-"
"framework-for-sustainable-rdf-data-processing/\">see blog post about "
"UnifiedViews</a>. More about ODN's components will be published in "
"subsequent articles.</p> <p>As already mentioned, <strong>ODN is "
"software</strong>. So it is not a service. But it can be used to create "
"one.</p> <p>And not just a software, <strong>ODN is Open Source "
"software</strong>, employing mainly combination of <a "
"href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html\">GPLv3</a> and <a "
"href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html\">LGPLv3</a>. Thus you "
"can use it yourself, without paying license fees. You can use it as it is"
" or you can customize it or integrate it with something else. If you are "
"not skilled enough, you can acquire customer support for this. You can "
"buy this support either from COMSODE consortium members (e.g. from <a "
"href=\"http://www.eea.sk\">EEA</a> Company) or you can buy that support "
"from somebody else, even building local expertise in your own "
"country.</p> <p>Given that, <strong>ODN can be also seen as integration "
"component</strong>, helping to reliably and safely bridge information "
"systems of public bodies with IT infrastructure of citizens and "
"businesses.</p> <h2>Is it all-in-one package, silver bullet?</h2> "
"<p>After reaching this point, you may think ODN is a wonder tool, doing "
"everything, The Only Right Solution In The World(TM), sort of silver "
"bullet. No, it is not.</p> <p>For more information visit web of <a "
